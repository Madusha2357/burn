        'Originally designed to carry 60 passengers, Nansen Explorer now carries only 12 guests in 7 staterooms. With an Ice-1A classed, 72-meter-long hull and an ice-experienced Captain and bridge team, she can sail further and penetrate deeper into ice than most yachts. An expansive heli-deck complete with onboard refueling capabilities allows exploration inland or heli-skiing. Kayaks, SUPs, and two MK V Zodiacs offer ample opportunities to explore more intimately.',

        'Hanse Explorer is a true expedition yacht in every sense with an ice-classed hull. Hanse Explorer carries two Mark-IV Zodiacs for landing on remote Pacific beaches and newly installed (2020) retractable stabilisers keep her steady at sea. 2021 also brought a multi-million-dollar refit to provide the yacht with a new, contemporary look and Nitrox diving center. Hanse Explorerâ€™s accommodation for 12 adventurous guests is smart and nautical, and a spacious saloon and adjacent dining room feature large windows to bring stunning scenery indoors. An expansive aft deck is used for al fresco dining.',
