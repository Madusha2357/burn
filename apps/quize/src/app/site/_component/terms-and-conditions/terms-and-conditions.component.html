      Burns
    </h1>

    
      <h2 class="green title-3">Key facts,</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An estimated 180 000 deaths every year are caused by burns. The vast majority occur in low- and middle-income countries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Burns occur mainly in the home and workplace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Burns are preventable.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <!--  -->
      <h2 class="green title-3">Overview,</h2>
      <p>A burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.</p>
      <p>Thermal (heat) burns occur when some or all the cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          hot liquids (scalds)
        </li>
        <li>
          hot solids (contact burns)
        </li>
        <li>
          flames (flame burns).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!--  -->
      <h2 class="green title-3">The problem</h2>
      <p>Burns are a global public health problem, accounting for an estimated 180 000 deaths annually. The majority of these occur in low- and middle-income countries and almost two thirds occur in the WHO African and South-East Asia Regions.</p>
      <p>In many high-income countries, burn death rates have been decreasing, and the rate of child deaths from burns is currently over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.</p>
      <p>Non-fatal burns are a leading cause of morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, disfigurement and disability, often with resulting stigma and rejection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Burns are among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in low- and middle-income countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hospitalization for burns varies by country and is influenced by health service payment programmes, but among countries studied hospitalization trends are going towards shorter stays and an increased proportion of burns being treated in specialized burn centres.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!--  -->
      <h2 class="green title-3">Some country data</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
        In India, over 1 million people are moderately or severely burnt every year.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nearly 173 000 Bangladeshi children are moderately or severely burnt every year.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt and Pakistan, 17% of children with burns have a temporary disability and 18% have a permanent disability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Burns are the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5% of disabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2008, over 410 000 burn injuries occurred in the United States of America, with approximately 40 000 requiring hospitalization.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="green title-3">In which settings do burns occur?</h2>
      <p>Burns occur mainly in the home and workplace. Community surveys in Bangladesh and Ethiopia show that 80â€“90% of burns occur at home. Children and women are usually burned in domestic kitchens, from upset receptacles containing hot liquids or flames, or from cookstove explosions. Men are most likely to be burned in the workplace due to fire, scalds, chemical and electrical burns.</p>


      <h2 class="green title-3">Prevention</h2>
      <p>Burns are preventable. High-income countries have made considerable progress in lowering rates of burn deaths, through a combination of prevention strategies and improvements in the care of people affected by burns. Most of these advances in prevention and care have been incompletely applied in low- and middle-income countries. Increased efforts to do so would likely lead to significant reductions in rates of burn-related death and disability.</p>
      <p>Prevention strategies should address the hazards for specific burn injuries, education for vulnerable populations and training of communities in first aid. An effective burn prevention plan should be multisectoral and include broad efforts to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        improve awareness
      </li>
      <li>
        develop and enforce effective policy
      </li>
      <li>
        describe burden and identify risk factors
      </li>
      <li>
        set research priorities with promotion of promising interventions
      </li>
      <li>
        provide burn prevention programmes
      </li>
      <li>
        strengthen burn care
      </li>
      <li>
        strengthen capacities to carry out all the above.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="green title-3">First aid</h2>
    <p>Basic guidance on first aid for burns is provided below.</p>
    <p><b>What to do</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop the burning process by removing clothing and irrigating the burns.</li>
      <li>Extinguish flames by allowing the patient to roll on the ground, or by applying a blanket, or by using water or other fire-extinguishing liquids.</li>
      <li>Use cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn.</li>
      <li>In chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.</li>
      <li>Wrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical care.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>What not to do</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not start first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off electrical current, wear gloves for chemicals etc.)</li>
      <li>Do not apply paste, oil, haldi (turmeric) or raw cotton to the burn.</li>
      <li>Do not apply ice because it deepens the injury.</li>
      <li>Avoid prolonged cooling with water because it will lead to hypothermia.</li>
      <li>Do not open blisters until topical antimicrobials can be applied, such as by a health-care provider.</li>
      <li>Do not apply any material directly to the wound as it might become infected.</li>
      <li>Avoid application of topical medication until the patient has been placed under appropriate medical care.</li>
    </ul>
